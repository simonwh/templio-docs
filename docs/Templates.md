# Templates üìù

Templates is at the core of Templio, and that's why we will start here.

Templates are `HTML` documents, enhanced with the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) templating language. This allows you to render variables and build advanced logic within your templates.

You can use [layouts](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/docs/Layouts.md) to define and re-use html, such as a header and footer. The template content will be rendered inside the layout.

The data provided to the template is known as `input data`. This data can be used directly as is, or be transformered via powerful javascript [pre-processors](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/docs/Pre-processors.md). You can even fetch additional data from external APIs that you need for your rendering!

When you've build your template, you send a simple request to our [Render API](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/reference/Templio-API.v1.yaml/paths/~1render/post) and we will return you the final, rendered template in no time ‚ö°.


## Creating a new template

To create a new template, go to `Templates` in the top menu and click `New Template`.

There's serveral inputs you need to fill out:

* **Name** - A name of the template, for you and your team to easily recognize the template.
* **Slug** - An identifier used when calling the Render API to identify this template, for example `my-template`.
* **Layout** (optional) - If you wish to use a [layout](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/docs/Layouts.md), select it here.
* **Inline CSS** (optional) - If your template is used as an email, you should check this, which will inline the CSS for maximum compatability with email clients.
* **Pre-processors** (optional) - Add the [pre-processors](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/docs/Pre-processors.md), if any, you wish to apply before rendering.

All of these settings can be edited at a later point, except the `slug`!

Click `Save` and the editor will open up directly.


## The editor

The template editor is a core component of Templio, and we're dedicated to building the best and easiest editor - so you don't have to!

We have plans to support different type of editors, such as simple Rich Text/WYSIWYG and block-style editors, but for now we're focusing on building a great code editor.

The editor has 3 sections or panes:

### Left pane - Inputs

In this pane, you have all the inputs necessary for your template render, and it's easy to view/edit the inputs when editing your template.

#### Preview Data

If your template needs `input data` to render, you can write in an example of the JSON data, and it will be used for the preview while you are working in the editor. The preview data will be saved, so you can quickly get started editing next time.

If you have assigned any [pre-processors](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/docs/Pre-processors.md) to your template, you will have the option to run the pre-processors on the input data you define, and the data will transform to the final state (after all pre-processors has run). You can easily switch back to the original preview data and trigger pre-proccesors to run again.

#### Translations
If you are using translations, you can view all the keys and values in the translations pane.

### Middle pane - Editor

### Right pane - Preview
