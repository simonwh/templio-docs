# Pre-processors

One of the most powerful features are Templio's Javascript pre-processors. A pre-processor is a snippet of Javascript code which receives `input data` and render configuration as input, and returns the same. Within the code, you can modify your data and change the rendering logic. It gives you _a lot_ of power over your templates. 

Pre-processors are great if you need to:

* Use advanced logic that is not easily doable in Liquid
* Transform input data into a different structure
* Fetch additional data from external APIs
* Overwrite render configuration, such as language, based on input data
* Anything else you do with Javascript and your data
