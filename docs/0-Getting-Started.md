# Getting Started ðŸš€

You're ready to get started with Templio, great! ðŸ’ª

We've split up these guides into the main concepts of Templio, and will explain each of them in detail in their own section.

You should also check out the very simple [API Documentation](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/reference/Templio-API.v1.yaml/paths/~1render/post), for details on how exactly to use the render endpoint.

1. [Templates](./1-Templates.md)
2. [Layouts](./2-Layouts.md)
3. [Pre-processors](./3-Pre-processors.md)
4. [Translations](./4-Translations.md)
5. [The editor](./5-Editor.md)
6. [Rendering](./6-Rendering.md)

## Quick walkthrough

In this section, we will walk through a simple workflow from editing to rendering, in two quick steps. We will use the onboarding template that was created when you first logged in.

### 1. Edit template

### 2. Render template

Rendering is as simple as sending a `POST` request to `https://api.templioapp.com/render?={template-slug}`.

As we saw when we edited the template, the input data expects a `name` property. We will send that in the JSON body in the request:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Elon Musk"
  }
}
```

The response will, by default, be a JSON object with the rendered template in the `result` property:

```json
{
  "result": "<html>...</html>"
}
```

You can try to query the Render API directly in the widget below, just press 'Send'!

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://api.templioapp.com/render?template=onboarding",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Apikey xxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": { "data": { "name": "Elon Musk" } }
}
```

There's a ton more you can do with Templio, but we hope you got the gist of it in this brief demo.
