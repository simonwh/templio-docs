# Getting Started ðŸš€

You're ready to get started with Templio, great! ðŸ’ª

We've split up these guides into the main concepts of Templio, and will explain each of them in detail in their own section.

You should also check out the very simple [API Documentation](https://templio.stoplight.io/docs/templio-docs/reference/Templio-API.v1.yaml/paths/~1render/post), for details on how exactly to use the render endpoint.

6. [Rendering](./6-Rendering.md)

## Quick demo

In this section, we will walk through a simple workflow from editing to rendering, in two quick steps. 

### 1. Edit template

We've created a new template and opened the editor. We will keep it really simple, with a quick "Hello". In the left pane, we defined the preview data, used for editing. We expect to receive a `name` in the request, so I add an example here in the preview:

### 2. Render template

Rendering is as simple as sending a `POST` request to `https://api.templioapp.com/render?={template-slug}`.

As we saw when we edited the template, the input data expects a `name` property. We will send that in the JSON body in the request:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Elon Musk"
  }
}
```

The response will, by default, be a JSON object with the rendered template in the `result` property:

```json
{
  "result": "<h1>Hello Elon Musk!</h1>"
}
```

You can try to query the Render API directly in the widget below, just press 'Send'!

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://api.templioapp.com/render?template=simple-demo",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Apikey 1762a910a46a7a4de325ddd847e250832ac645fcf9089e405b95298f64658386",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": { "data": { "name": "Elon Musk" } }
}
```

You can try and change the `name` in the `data` property, to see the template rendering with different date.

There's a ton more you can do with Templio, but we hope you got the gist of it in this brief demo.
